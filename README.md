# ScientificInstruments

The dataset is based on two surveys that gauged academicsâ€™ perceptions on the credibility of references to scientific instruments in natural science journals. The code is written in SPSS, and interrogates two Excel files (Survey 1 Dataset, Survey 2 Dataset). The first line in the dataset contains the label for the variables. An explanation of each variable in the Excel dataset can be found below. Some items (university affiliation, year of earning PhD) have been removed to ensure anonymity of the respondents.
